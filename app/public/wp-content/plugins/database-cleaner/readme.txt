**IMPORTANT**: Remember to always back up your data before using this or any plugin! While it performs reliably, it's always best to play it safe. Better safe than sorry! :)

== Features ==

- **Dual Mode Functionality**: Choose between **Easy** mode for beginners or **Expert** mode for advanced users, catering to different skill levels.
- **Auto Clean Feature: With a simple click, select items for automatic cleaning. The plugin efficiently takes care of the rest, saving you time and effort.

Additionally, Database Cleaner provides specialized tools for in-depth analysis and monitoring of how your data is utilized across different areas: **Post Types**, **Tables**, **Options**, and **Cron Jobs**.

== Why this plugin? ==

While other database cleaners are available, my experience with them revealed areas for improvement, like outdated UIs, incomplete features, and limited data analysis capabilities. Most notably, they struggled with large databases. Motivated by these challenges, I developed my own solution. Now, I'm dedicated to refining it to suit all types of WordPress and databases, aiming to make it the best for everyone.

I'm open to feedback and would be thrilled to discuss how Database Cleaner can better meet your needs. Let's chat and enhance this tool together!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Meow Apps -> Database Cleaner in the sidebar and check the appropriate options.
4. Click on the button to clean your database automatically.
